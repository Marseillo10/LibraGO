The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming very poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot.", "excerpts": [{"excerpt": "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.", "comment": "first sentence", "author": {"key": "/people/seabelis"}}], "first_publish_date": "1853", "key": "/works/OL66554W", "links": [{"title": "Wikipedia entry", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}, {"title": "thegreatestbooks.org/items/102", "url": "https://thegreatestbooks.org/items/102", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}, {"title": "Pride and Prejudice | Summary, Characters, Author, Book ...", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pride-and-Prejudice", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}, {"title": "Pride and Prejudice: List of Characters - Austenprose", "url": "https://austenprose.com/pride-and-prejudice-character-list/", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}, {"title": "Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen", "url": "https://love-books-review.com/blog/pride-and-prejudice-by-jane-austen/", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}}], "subject_people": ["Elizabeth Bennet", "Fitzwilliam Darcy", "Charlotte Lucas", "George Wickham", "Mr. Bennet", "Mrs. Bennet", "Jane Bennet", "Mary Bennet", "Catherine Bennet", "Lydia Bennet", "Charles Bingley", "Caroline Bingley", "William Collins", "Catherine de Bourgh"], "subject_places": ["England", "Brighton", "Derbyshire", "Hertfordshire", "Meryton", "Longbourn", "Netherfield", "Pemberley", "Great Britain", "Ying guo"], "subject_times": ["1789-1820", "19th century", "Jin dai"], "subjects": ["Fiction, Romance, Historical, Regency", "British and Irish fiction (fictional works by one author)", "Brothers and sisters", "Courtship", "Drama", "English fiction", "English literature", "Families", "Family", "Family life", "Family relations", "Fiction Classics", "History", "Interpersonal relations", "Literary Fiction", "Love stories", "manners", "Manners and customs", "marriage", "Sisters", "Social classes", "Social life and customs", "Upper class", "wealth", "Women in England", "young ladies", "Young women", "entail", "Young women, fiction", "Sisters, fiction", "Fiction, family life, general", "England, fiction", "Man-woman relationships, fiction", "Roman anglais", "Classes sociales", "Romans, nouvelles", "S\u0153urs", "Amours", "Jeunes femmes", "Familles", "M\u0153urs et coutumes\"", "Clases sociales", "Novela", "J\u00f3venes (Mujeres)", "Cortejo amoroso", "Hermanas", "Cuentos de amor", "Fiction, coming of age", "Fiction, romance, general", "Great britain, social life and customs, fiction", "Readers", "Prejudices", "Romance fiction", "Historical fiction", "Classical literature", "Domestic fiction", "English language, textbooks for foreign speakers", "Women, fiction", "Adaptations", "Gentry", "Mate selection", "Fiction, romance, historical, general", "English literature (collections)", "Coloring books", "Fiction, family life", "Language and languages, study and teaching", "Emoticons", "Drama (dramatic works by one author)", "Feelings", "Class", "Englisch", "Roman", "Sociala klasser i litteraturen", "Prophecies", "Great britain", "Reading level-grade 7", "Reading level-grade 9", "Reading level-grade 8", "Reading level-grade 11", "Reading level-grade 10", "Reading level-grade 12", "Large type books", "Fiction, romance, historical", "Austen, jane, 1775-1817", "Literature and fiction (general)", "English literature, history and criticism", "England", "\u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 -- \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f -- \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 -- 1-\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b. 19 \u0432. -- \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044b", "Novel", "Fiction", "Long Now Manual for Civilization", "Elizabeth Bennet (Fictitious character)", "Fitzwilliam Darcy (Fictitious character)", "Pride and prejudice (Austen, Jane)", "Mr. Collins (Fictitious character)"], "title": "Pride and Prejudice", "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "works": ["Love stories, English"], "latest_revision": 114, "revision": 114, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-10-16T02:23:26.818127"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2025-11-01T19:48:19.406425"}}
